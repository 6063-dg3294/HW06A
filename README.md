# Q & A
### Which text did you choose? Who wrote it? When? Where is it from?  
I like wind. I went to look for poems about wind, and I picked this one from Discover Poetry.com (https://discoverpoetry.com/poems/wind-poems/):   
  
**"Who Has Seen the Wind?"**
by Christina Georgina Rossetti  
  
Who has seen the wind?  
Neither I nor you:  
But when the leaves hang trembling,  
The wind is passing through.  


### How is the animation related to the text?  

### What were some of the challenges when implementing this exercise?  
I want to create the leaf movements using sin() and cosine. I went to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWIcAWYm-aU learn this on YouTube. It was hard for me to understand angle increment and how to relate that with sin() when writing. I had to find examples of how people use the triangle stuffs to debug. 



### Include drawings and images of reference visualizations
I had this initial attempt to create a basic scene of leaves waving in the wind. I used class(), function(), and shake().

Then, I want the leaves to be more concreate.   
I drew this sketch with leaves that change its position & a eye in the bg.  
![image description](./2.png)
Regarding the eye, I wanted it to be wise. I used this image as a reference.

To complete a pupil in the middle, I used sin() and angle again to create the shape made up of "X."

Double layer it is.
