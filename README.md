# Q & A
### Which text did you choose? Who wrote it? When? Where is it from?  
I like wind. I went to look for poems about wind, and I picked this one from Discover Poetry.com (https://discoverpoetry.com/poems/wind-poems/):   
  
**"Who Has Seen the Wind?"**
by Christina Georgina Rossetti  
  
Who has seen the wind?  
Neither I nor you:  
But when the leaves hang trembling,  
The wind is passing through.
